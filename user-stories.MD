As a user, I want an app that randomly displays three items side by side for the user to choose between.
As a developer, I want the app to accurately count how many times each item has been chosen, and store this data to allow for multiple uses without erasing the data.
As a user, I want the app to display the data to the user only after they have made 25 selections. At this point the user will be able to choose between viewing the results or making 10 additional selections.
